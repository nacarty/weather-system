This application works perfectly from codepen.io but it does have some layout issues here.

This web application figures out your location (latitude and longitude) using the browser's geolocation API,
looks up the address using Google API, finds the weather forecast, hourly for the next 24 hours, and daily 
for the next 8 days. the application also allows the user to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit. 
Lastly, it generates a Google map of the location, displaying a summary of the prevailing conditions in an
information window.

Please see:

Link 1: This should give you a better estimate of your present location, but you should use IE.

Link 2: This should give you a rough estimate of your present location based on your ISP location, but you have greater flexibility of choice of browser.
